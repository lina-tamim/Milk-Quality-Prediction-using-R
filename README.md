# Milk-Quality-Prediction-using-R
This repository combines Classification and Clustering tasks for milk analysis. We classify milk grades as low, medium, or high, and perform clustering analysis based on dataset attributes. Data preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and encoding, is implemented to ensure accurate analysis and prediction of milk quality.
